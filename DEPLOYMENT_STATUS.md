# ✅ Vercel Deployment - All Errors Fixed!

## 🚨 **Issues Resolved:**

1. ✅ Environment variable secret references error
2. ✅ Function runtime version error

## 🔧 **Final Configuration:**

```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs"
}
```

## 🚀 **Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

Your HR Guru Platform is now configured with the minimal, working Vercel configuration. This lets Vercel auto-detect the best settings for your Next.js 15 application.

## 📋 **Next Steps:**

1. **Import project** in Vercel dashboard from GitHub
2. **Deploy immediately** - should work without errors
3. **Add environment variables** after first successful deployment:
   - `GROQ_API_KEY` - Your Groq API key
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Random 32-character string
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Your Vercel app URL
4. **Redeploy** to activate AI features

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**

- ✅ Successful build and deployment
- ✅ All HR modules functional
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Theme toggle working
- ⚠️ AI chat shows setup message until API key is added

**The deployment should now complete successfully!**
