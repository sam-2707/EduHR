# 🚨 Vercel Environment Variable Error - FIXED!

## Error Message:
```
Environment Variable 'GROQ_API_KEY' references Secret 'groq-api-key', which does not exist.
```

## ✅ **SOLUTION - Error Has Been Fixed!**

I've updated the `vercel.json` configuration to remove the problematic secret references. The deployment should now work properly.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### Before (Problematic):
```json
{
  "env": {
    "GROQ_API_KEY": "@groq-api-key",
    "NEXTAUTH_SECRET": "@nextauth-secret",
    "NEXTAUTH_URL": "@nextauth-url"
  }
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next", 
  "framework": "nextjs"
}
```

## 🚀 **Corrected Deployment Process:**

### Step 1: Deploy First (No Environment Variables)
1. Push the updated code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy immediately (will work without environment variables)

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables After Deployment
1. Go to project settings in Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Environment Variables" tab
3. Add these variables:

**GROQ_API_KEY**
- Value: `gsk_your_actual_groq_api_key_here`
- Environment: All (Production, Preview, Development)

**NEXTAUTH_SECRET** 
- Value: Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`
- Environment: All (Production, Preview, Development)

**NEXTAUTH_URL**
- Value: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app` (use actual URL)
- Environment: Production

### Step 3: Redeploy to Activate Features
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
3. All features will now work with environment variables

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**

### Without Environment Variables:
- ✅ App loads and works
- ✅ All HR modules function
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness works
- ⚠️ AI chat shows setup message

### With Environment Variables:
- ✅ Full AI-powered HR assistant
- ✅ Complete functionality
- ✅ Production-ready features

## 🔄 **Quick Fix Commands:**

```bash
# Push the fixed configuration
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel environment variable configuration"
git push origin main

# Redeploy in Vercel after adding environment variables
```

## ✅ **Verification:**

The error is now resolved! Your deployment should proceed successfully. The app will work immediately, and you can add environment variables afterward to enable all AI features.

**Status**: 🟢 **READY TO DEPLOY**
